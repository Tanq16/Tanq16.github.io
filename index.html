										<p align="justify">
											"Everything has a workaround". That's an ideology I strongly believe in. It's not just something to do with generic hacking, but a reminder that every problem has not just a solution, but a smart solution. I try to find such smart and witty solutions for all puzzles of my life. <br><br>With a passion for computers and security, I present myself to the world as a Cyber Security Practitioner/Enthusiast/Student. I hold a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and am currently pursuing a Masters of Science in Cyber Security from Georgia Tech. Such a background allows me to relate day to day functioning of every aspect of life to the intricacies of a computer system. On top of that, I possess a fortunate touch of mild laziness and witty impulsiveness, which helps unlock a whole new perspective when thinking of solutions to tricky problems. I use these skills to learn more about Cyber Security, to identify loopholes and ponder about a solid secure design for different systems.<br><br>
											I haven't always been a CS geek, but my mind shifted dimensions when I first learned about Operating Systems and Networks. The amount of thought that was put into designing these systems, trying to isolate mechanisms to keep stuff secure, was just mind boggling. Goosebumps on my limbs and chills of awe down my spine hinted at my conscience to learn more and more. And so, I decided to make Cyber Security the career I wanted to pursue! I read blogs, watched lecture videos, participated in CTF competitions and did an internship to learn as much as I could about security. In-Room hacking was the most enjoyable activity during my undergrad. I started attending Security Conferences and decided to pursue my masters, where I have learnt so much more than I could have ever imagined, while also heightening walls that I must now climb to achieve more in this field. <br><br>
											I now spend my days studying several courses for my Masters degree while being involved in several projects for courses like Applied Cryptography, Network Security and Secure Computer Systems. Playing CTFs, playing drums and clicking photographs are three constructive hobbies that I pursue. My aim is to be a successful Cyber Security Practitioner in the industry and experience Security in a manner which is more hands on than I have ever experienced before. I hope to make a positive contribution and give back to the Cybersec community that has helped me get to where I am today. <br> <br><br><br> <br>
