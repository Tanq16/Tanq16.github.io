										<p align="justify">
											"Everything has a workaround". That's an ideology I strongly believe in. It's not just something to do with generic hacking, but a reminder that every problem has not just a solution, but a smart solution. I try to find such smart and witty solutions for all puzzles of my life. <br><br>With a passion for computers and security, I present myself to the world as a Cyber Security Practitioner/Enthusiast/Student. I hold a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and am currently pursuing a Masters of Science in Cyber Security from Georgia Tech. Such a background allows me to connect with the world through the mind of a computer scientist, so much so that I relate day to day functioning of every aspect of life to the intricacies of a computer system. On top of that, I possess a fortunate touch of mild laziness and witty impulses, which help unlock a whole new perspective when thinking of solutions to tricky problems. I try to use these skills to learn more about Cyber Security, apply my knowledge to identify loopholes and ponder about a solid secure design for different systems.<br><br>
											I haven't always been a CS geek, but everything changed the day when I first typed <i>whoami</i> on the linux terminal. That one command gave me a huge insight to the words "authority" and "privilege" with respect to computer systems. My mind shifted dimensions when I first learned about Operating Systems and Networks. The amount of thought that was put into designing these systems, trying to isolate mechanisms to keep stuff secure, was just mind boggling. Goosebumps on my limbs and chills of awe down my spine hinted at my conscience to learn more and more. And so, I decided to make Cyber Security the career I wanted to pursue! I read blogs, watched lecture videos, participated in CTF competitions and did an internship to learn as much as I could about security. Learning about hacking was the most enjoyable activity during my undergrad. Having built a fundamental understanding of Cyber Security, I started attending Security Conferences and decided to pursue my masters, where I have learnt so much more than I could have ever imagined, while also heightening walls that I must now climb to achieve more in this field. <br><br>
											I now spend my days studying several courses for my Masters degree as well as working as a Teaching Assistant for the course "Introduction to Information Security", which helps keep my basics refreshed. I am involved in several projects for courses like Applied Cryptography, Network Security and Secure Computer Systems, which I currently study as a part of my curriculum. Playing CTFs, playing drums and clicking photographs are three constructive hobbies that I pursue in my free time. <br><br>
											My aim is to be a successful Cyber Security Practitioner in the industry and experience Security in a manner which is more hands on than I have ever experienced before. I hope to make a positive contribution and give back to the Cybersec community that has helped me get to where I am today. <br> <br>
